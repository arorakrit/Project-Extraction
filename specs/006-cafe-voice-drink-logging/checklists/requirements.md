# Specification Quality Checklist: Café-First Drink Logging with Voice Capture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass on first validation (2026-06-12).
- Two interpretation calls were made deliberately and recorded in Assumptions rather
  than left as clarification markers: (1) the café is emphasized but **not** made a
  required field; (2) coffee-detail fields are **demoted behind an expansion, not
  removed**. If either reading is wrong, revisit via `/speckit-clarify` before
  `/speckit-plan`.
